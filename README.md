# Proof of Concept for: Dynamic Data-filtering-problem.

This repo contains the source code of the implentation details about dynamic data-filtering.

The solution works perfectly fine for relational databases, anyone who is using MySQL and PostgreSQL can laverage this since it's been fully tested
on these RDBs, the aim is to support any RDBs. It works against any string leterals, no wild-cards support(not recommended)
